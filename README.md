# TimeChamp

An application for logging [TimeCamp](https://www.timecamp.com) time tracking
from [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) and automatically
filling unallocated time.

## Usage

```shell
java -jar timechamp.jar fill-days [-s START_DATE] [-e END_DATE] 
                                  [--hours-worked HOURS]
                                  [-c GOOGLE_SECRETS_FILE] [-d DATA_STORE_DIR]
                                  [-t TIMECAMP_API_TOKEN] [-i CALENDAR_ID] [-w]
                                  [TASK_TIME_PAIR...]

java -jar timechamp.jar list-tasks [-t TIMECAMP_API_TOKEN]
```

## fill-days
### Description
TimeChamp will blindly shove Google calendar events into TimeCamp, and
optionally create events to fill unallocated time. *Currently it keeps only
durations from calendar events, throwing away specific start and end times by
moving events to the beginning of the workday.*

TimeChamp allocates free time into tasks using the `TASK_TIME_PAIR` arguments,
where each pair maps a task ID to either an absolute length of time or a
percentage of free time spent on that task. TimeChamp first creates tasks from
the absolute durations provided, then, if any time remains available in the day,
subdivides the free time according to any percentages supplied.

You are required to have Google service account credentials, a TimeCamp API
token, and knowledge of the somewhat hidden TimeCamp task IDs. These
requirements are described in more detail their own sections below.

### Arguments:
#### Positional arguments:

`TASK_TIME_PAIR...`  
_Optional._  
_Ex:_ `1234 1h 2345 1h30m 3456 80% 4567 20%`

A `TASK_TIME_PAIR` is a space-separated pair of a (numeric) TimeCamp task id and
either an absolute length time or a percentage of free time. TimeChamp will
first create events from any tasks with absolute durations provided, then, if
total event duration is less than hours worked, will portion the remaining time
according to any percentages supplied.

Absolute times are specified as hours and/or minutes in the form `XhYm`,
e.g. `1h30m`, `1.5h`, `90m`. Percentages are specified as `X%`, e.g. `25%`. Thus
the list of `TASK_TIME_PAIR...` might look like
`1234 1h 2345 30m 3456 80% 4567 20%`.

Hours and minutes may be floats, but will be rounded to the nearest minute.
Percents may be floats and need not sum to 1; it is valid to specify tasks take
up only a fraction of the unallocated time.  Percentages greater than 1 are also
respected for some reason.

#### Named arguments:

`-s, --start-date START_DATE`  
_Default: Current date_  
Start date (inclusive) in `yyyy-MM-dd` format

`-e, --end-date END_DATE`  
_Default: Current date_  
End date (inclusive) in `yyyy-MM-dd` format

`--hours-worked HOURS`  
_Default:_ `8`  
Hours worked per day. Must be less than 15, as events are moved to begin at 9am.

`-g, --gc-secrets-file GOOGLE_SECRETS_FILE`  
_Default:_ `$TIMECHAMP_GOOGLE_SECRETS_FILE` _or_ `~/.timechamp/google-secrets.json`  
Path to Google client secrets JSON file. See the
[Google OAuth section](#google-oauth) for more information.

`-d, --data-store-dir DATA_STORE_DIR`  
_Default:_ `$TIMECHAMP_DATA_STORE_DIR` _or_ `~/.timechamp/data/`  
Path to the folder where the Google client will save its auth information
between uses. See the [Google OAuth section](#google-oauth) for more
information.

`-t, --tc-api-token TIMECAMP_API_TOKEN`  
_Default:_ `$TIMECAMP_API_TOKEN`  
TimeCamp API token. See the [TimeCamp API token section](#timecamp-api-token)
for more information.

`-c, --calendar-id CALENDAR_ID`  
_Default:_ `"primary"`  
ID of the Google calendar to read events from. Unless you've created multiple
calendars on the account and know which you want, the default is what you want.

`-w, --include-weekends`  
Create events for weekends.

`-h, --help`  

## list-tasks
Prints TimeCamp tasks and task IDs available to the provided TimeCamp account.

### Arguments
#### Named arguments:
`-t, --tc-api-token TC_API_TOKEN`  
_Default:_ `$TC_API_TOKEN`  
TimeCamp API token. See the [TimeCamp API token section](#timecamp-api-token)

## Getting Started

The easiest way to run this is to download the standalone version of the
[latest jar file from GitHub](https://github.com/jacobboy/timechamp/releases)
and run

``` shell
java -jar path/to/jar <subcommand> [<args>]
```
e.g.
``` shell
java -jar timechamp.jar fill-days 9238 1h30m 8302 75m 8380 50% 8856 10%
```
To run or build from source, install [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/), cd to
the base of the repo, and execute `lein run -- <args>` to run or `lein uberjar`
to package.

## Requirements
### Task IDs
A list of all task IDs available to your account is available through the
`list-tasks` subcommand. Provide your API token via the `-t` option or
`TC_API_TOKEN` environment variable.  This subcommand prints a human readable
mapping of tasks and IDs.

### Credentials

#### Google OAuth
To retrieve data from your Google calendar, you will need an OAuth secrets file
from a project with access to the Calendar API. If the path to this file is not
supplied via CLI, TimeChamp will first check the `TIMECHAMP_GOOGLE_SECRETS_FILE`
environment variable, then the default path `~/.timechamp/google-secrets.json`.

Google OAuth also requires a directory in which to store authentication
information between uses. This allows you to not need to reauthorize your Google
credentials each use. If the path is not supplied via CLI, TimeChamp will first
check the `TIMECHAMP_DATA_STORE_DIR` variable, then will use the default path
`~/.timechamp/google-secrets.json`. The path used will be created if it does not
exist.

To obtain the OAuth secrets file, as of mid-2017 you can:

##### Create a new project
Go to https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials
and select `Create`. The name is not required to match this application.

##### Create OAuth client ID
1. In the Credentials section, click "Create credentials" and select "OAuth
   client ID".
2. For a new project, it'll have you configure the consent screen.  You'll have
   to provide the name that'll be shown on the OAuth consent screen, the rest of
   the form is optional. Click "Save".
3. Select "Other" as the application type and provide a name for the
   credentials. It'll give you a pop-up with your client ID and secret, which
   you need not save. Click through and you'll be returned to the Credentials
   page.
4. Download the client secrets file by clicking the download button for the
   credentials you just created. Move this to somewhere it won't get lost. The
   path to the downloaded file will be provided to TimeChamp either via the `-g`
   command line option, the `TIMECHAMP_GOOGLE_SECRETS_FILE` environment
   variable, or, if neither is provided, the default location is
   `~/.timechamp/google-secrets.json`.
5. Enable the Calendar API for this project.

##### Enable Calendar API for this project
Click the Library tab or go to
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library, search for and select Google
Calendar API, click Enable at the top.


#### TimeCamp API token
Your TimeCamp API token is available at the bottom of TimeCamp's User Settings
page. 

If not supplied via CLI, TimeChamp with use the the `TIMECAMP_API_TOKEN`
environment variable. Note that this is `TIMECAMP_API_TOKEN` rather than
`TIMECHAMP_API_TOKEN`.
